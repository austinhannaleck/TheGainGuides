                         <p>
                             My passion for fitness derived from my own personal struggles with eating. Battling anorexia nervosa for years isn't something I would wish upon my worst enemy-but it did get me to where I am today. I consider myself blessed, blessed to have been a few pounds away from my deathbed and somehow made it out to the other side. This experience of mine is something I will forever hold close to me, and that's because I see it as what created my entire life's purpose-to help others be at peace with themselves. Fitness saved my life. It taught me patience, it taught me discipline, and it taught me how to properly take care of myself. If it could save my life, who says it can't save someone else's?

                           If you're anything like me, you may experience a bit of an "all or nothing" attitude. Over the years, through trial and error, I've learned that your health and wellness shouldn't be treated as something you either give 100% of yourself to or 0% of yourself to. I promote what I believe in - and that's creating a healthy lifestyle for yourself that's sustainable. I believe in listening to your body, mind, and heart. If you can't see yourself following a certain diet for the rest of your life, it's not going to work. What will work, however, is to entirely drop the diet mindset and focus on a lifestyle.

                            The Gains Guide is something I created geared towards women. This is mainly because, being a woman myself, I understand the common misconceptions about girls and weight lifting. I myself have discovered what techniques to use to achieve the physique and mindset I've always wanted to have, and I want to share that with the world. Aenean eget convallis urna.
